# About this document

This guide will help you deploy a microserviced application that you can then protect with a CNAPP solution for use in various lab exercises. It is designed to help you experience the different capabilities of a CNAPP and how they can all be brought to bear on a single application.

The activities in this guide can be broken down into the following phases:

- Create a Kubernetes cluster on GCP
- Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster

At this point, the application that will be used as the baseline application is the Google-maintain Online Botique application. This sample microservices application was designed for deployment on GCP. Therefore the manual steps required to deploy this application for GCP is unnecessary at this point in time, and will be written when warranted.

For instructions on how to deploy the Online Boutique application, refer here:
